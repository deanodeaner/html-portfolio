<h1>The Best Movies According to Dean</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Avengers: Endgame</h3>
    <p>The best conclusion to a franchise! Or maybe a Marvel saga...</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Special mention to my favourite Marvel characters: <u><i>Doctor Strange</i></u> and <u><i>Scarlet Witch</i></u>!</li>
    </ul>
<h3>Spider-Man: No Way Home</h3>
    <p>Yes, another Marvel movie! This brought some nostalgic vibe when the previous Spider-Men showed up. Toby's Spider-Man brings back awesome childhood memories!</p>
<h3>Free Guy</h3>
    <p>I'm a fan of Deadpool and Steve Harrington so I was eager to watch this film! This has programming involved, I see this film as one of my motivation to learn web development (and CS in general)!</p>
